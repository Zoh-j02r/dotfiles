# [Zoh-j02r](https://github.com/Zoh-j02r) dotfiles
-------------------
A dotfile is how you can customize your system once and keep you from reconfiguring everything every time you get a new computer or format one.  These are my dotfiles for multipurpose tasks, with scripts written mostly with shell scripting and [Lua](https://www.lua.org/about.html), focused on simplicity and minimalism for my [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org/) system.
#### About this project
-----------------------
As said above this project is focused on  minimalism and simplicity, my take on a minimalist system is that there must be low overhead, small programs must be used. There is no need for many applications since the great ones can achieve the same functionality. With that said, I had the intention to make a working system following this principle. I decided to use mostly [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) applications that dependencies cycles around [GTK](https://gtk.org/about/), so no cool looking rounded-blurry-transparent stuff here.

#### Scripts
------------
I made a script to help me to make changes in colors of multiple configured programs at once to save time. For now, it is very basic, but with time it will certainly be great. I have the intention to make another script related to screen capture under Wayland using [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/about.html).
